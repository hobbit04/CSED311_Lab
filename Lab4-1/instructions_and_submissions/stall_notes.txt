I. Conceptual ideas
    1. When to stall? (without data forwarding)
        >> check if ID's registers is used in either EX or MEM
        >> (in WB, updates happen in negedge and reads happen in posedge, so no conflict there.)
    2. What to change when stalling?
        >> Disable PC & IR latching
            >> Merely disabling PC isn't enough (think about it)
        >> Turn off control's "write" values (memwrite, regwrite)

II. Implementation details
    1. When to stall?
        >> check (we're using?) and (they're using too?)
            we're using?
              >> rs1: R type, I type ALU, load, store, ecall
              >> rs2: R type, store
            they're using too?
              >> whenever regwrite is enabled
        >> Package all this logic to "StallDetection" with a single output
    2. What to change when stalling?
        a. disabling PC and IR latching
            >> Basically just add a condition "if (!is_stall)" in the update stage
        b. Setting control values to 0
            >> In the ID pipeline register update stage, put an additional if statement
            >> Should be pretty straightforward
